# NotAA Website Deployment

## Prerequisites

Before deploying your website, ensure you have the following:

1. **Modify `config.js`:** Update the values for links and variables in `config.js` to reflect your site settings.
2. **Cloudflare Account:** Create a Cloudflare account if you don't already have one.
3. **Workers & Pages:** In the Cloudflare dashboard, navigate to the "Workers & Pages" section (this will appear after hovering over "Overview" in the left pane).
4. **Pages Tab:** Select the "Pages" tab below "Create an Application."
5. **Upload Assets:** Click "Upload assets" and either upload a folder or a zip file containing your site files.
6. **Deploy Application and Link Domain:** Once your site is created, you can link it via the UI. This will guide you through creating a CNAME record pointing to your Worker Page Application.
